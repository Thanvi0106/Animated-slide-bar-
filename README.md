The Animated Navigation Sidebar is a modern and interactive UI component that provides a smooth, layered navigation experience inspired by Netflixâ€™s design aesthetics. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates clean animations, transitions, and responsive sidebar functionality for mobile and web layouts.

The sidebar expands and collapses with animated layers (black â†’ red â†’ white) for a sleek and engaging effect. It includes navigation links, nested submenus, and interactive open/close buttons.
